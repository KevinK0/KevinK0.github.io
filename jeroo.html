		<h2>Unit 1</h2>
		<p>Description: In the first unit of Jeroo, we had to get a jeroo to move, pick and toss flowers, and turn in different directions. We solved basic problems that didn’t require loops or if statements.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to instantiate Jeroos, use the hop();, toss(); turn();, and the pick(); commands. I also learned how the curly braces work in the main method.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>Unit 2</h2>
		<p>Description: In the second unit of Jeroo, we had to use additional methods, other than the main one, in order to accomplish specific goals. The goals were similar to those of unit one, except more repetitive, warranting the use of those additional methods.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to create additional methods so that I didn’t have to copy and paste code all over the place.</p>
		</br>
		<h2>Unit 3</h2>
		<p>Description: In the third unit of Jeroo, we were given tasks that required Boolean methods to solve. These included predominantly “if” statements, so that the program would check for flowers, water, etc., and perform an action based on the results.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to use the "if(isWater(AHEAD))", as well as isClear, isFlower, and isNet. I also learned how to coordinate all of the curly braces required for the statements to be properly interpreted by the program.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>Unit 4</h2>
		<p>Description: In the Fourth unit of Jeroo, we were instructed to perform tasks that required loops and “if/else” statements to solve properly. The loops were constructed using the "while (booleanMethod(RelativeDirection))" setup.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to use the "while (isClear(AHEAD))", as well as isWater, isFlower, and isNet. I also learned how to modify “if” statements so that I could accomplish tasks where I couldn’t have two separate if statements.</p>
