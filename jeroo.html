		<h2>Unit 1</h2>
		<p>Description: In the first unit of Jeroo, we had to get a jeroo to move, pick and toss flowers, and turn in different directions. We solved basic problems that didn’t require loops or if statements. It was a very simple introduction to Jeroo.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to instantiate Jeroos, use the hop();, toss(); turn();, and the pick(); commands. I learned how the curly braces work in the main method. I also learned how to organize the order of commands so that my code worked correctly.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>Unit 2</h2>
		<p>Description: In the second unit of Jeroo, we had to use additional methods, other than the main one, in order to accomplish specific goals. The goals were similar to those of unit one, except more repetitive. This warranted the use of those additional methods.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to create additional methods so that I didn’t have to copy and paste code all over the place. I learned how to nest methods, as well. I also learned how many brackets each metod needs to have around it and how to format everything. </p>
		</br>
		<h2>Unit 3</h2>
		<p>Description: In the third unit of Jeroo, we were given tasks that required Boolean methods to solve. These included predominantly “if” statements, so that the program would check for flowers, water, etc. It would then perform an action based on the results.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to use the "if(isWater(AHEAD))", as well as isClear, isFlower, and isNet. I also learned how to coordinate all of the curly braces required for the statements to be properly interpreted by the program. I learned how to nest if statements as well.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>Unit 4</h2>
		<p>Description: In the Fourth unit of Jeroo, we were instructed to perform tasks that required loops and “if/else” statements to solve properly. The loops were constructed using the "while (booleanMethod(RelativeDirection))" setup. These would have been every useful in the previous unit.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to use the "while (isClear(AHEAD))", as well as isWater, isFlower, and isNet. I also learned how to modify “if” statements. This was so that I could accomplish tasks where I couldn’t have two separate if statements.</p>
