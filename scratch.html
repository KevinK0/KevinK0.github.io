		<h1> Scratch Projects: </h1>
		
		<p style="color: lightBlue">`</p>
		
		<h2> Name Assignment </h2> 
		
		<p>Description: Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them three unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the  scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I’ve used Scratch extensively prior to this class, so I didn’t learn anything new. A few things that we reviewed included the start blocks, basic movement and sprite commands, as well as loops and basis “if” statements.</p>
		<h2> Computer Buying Project </h2>
		
		<p>Description: Use Scratch to create a presentation that would discuss potential computers for someone to buy. We had to interview someone we knew and record their responses about computers. We then had to research four computer options for them and compare our choices. Of those four, we had to pick a “winner” of sorts and be able to explain why that particular computer was best for the person we interviewed.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: Other than importing images into scratch, again, nothing new. Some things included were changing backdrops, variables, and again the “if” statements and loops.</p>
		<h2>Scratch Final Project</h2>
		
		<p>Description: Use Scratch to create a game. The requirements were that the game had to keep score, have a timer and a help screen, and needed to end when the player had won. The game also had to have multiple levels, and needed to reset when the green flag was clicked. </p>
		<p>Concepts Learned:
I learned how to construct complex variable sets and how to randomize platforms’ spawns. I also learned how to create a 2-dimensional platformer in scratch. I experimented with broadcast commands and layered “if” statements, and also with creating my own pixelated sprites.</p>
