		<h2>Favorite Projects and Assignments</h2>
		<h3>Scratch Final Project:</h3>
		<p>I loved this project. I took a few creative liberties in terms of the actual assignment, and lost a couple points, but I had so much fun doing it. It was great. I was also super happy with the end result; the game works really well.

		<p>I love to play Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. It's a great game, and I play it pretty often. I always use R.O.B.; he's my favorite character.</p>
		<h3> CCA Swim & Dive</h3>
		<img src="images/Swim1.jpg" height=250 width=400>
		<p>I'm part of varsity on the CCA Swim and Dive team. My best stroke is butterfly, and I've been swimming since I was little. I enjoy swimming a lot; but I only really swim during the season because I'm often too busy the rest of the year.
