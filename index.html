		<h2>Favorite Projects and Assignments</h2>
		<h3>Scratch Final Project:</h3>
		<p>I loved this project. I took a few creative liberties in terms of the actual assignment, and I lost a couple points, but I had so much fun doing it. It was great. I was also super happy with the end result; the game works really well.<p>
		</br>
		<h3>Final-Final Project:</h3>	
		<p>Description: I decided to do my final project in Scratch. It is a platformer in which the player must dodge several different enemies and projectiles and defeat a final boss. There are five levels. The first and second levels are just platforms and one enemy, which crawls along the bottom platform. The third level adds a flying enemy that shoots at the player's character and avoids being hit with attacks. Both enemies deal progressively more damage as the player gets past levels. The player gets a sword on level four, which allows the player to kill the enemies without taking any damage themselves. Both enemies disappear once the level reaches five, so that player can fight a final boss. The final boss shoots a lot of projectiles at the player and the projectiles deal a lot of damage. If the player blocks them, though, the boss takes damage and the player does not. The game ends if the player falls of the platforms, has a Health less than zero, or defeats the final boss. On the menu screen, if the user is idle too long, a slideshow will play that shows the backstory of the game. It has a test mode that can be turned on by pressing 1-3-3-7 on the keypad. Visit the final project page to play it.</p>

		<p>I love to play Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. It's a great game, and I play it pretty often. I always use R.O.B.; he's my favorite character.</p>
		<h3> CCA Swim & Dive</h3>

		<p>I'm part of varsity on the CCA Swim and Dive team. My best stroke is butterfly, and I've been swimming since I was little. I enjoy swimming a lot; but I only really swim during the season because I'm often too busy the rest of the year.</p>

		<p>I play Magic: The Gathering in my free time. It's a really fun game, and I'm not totally horrible at it.</p>
