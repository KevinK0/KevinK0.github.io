		<h2>Final Project</h2>
		<p>Description: I decided to do my final project in Scratch. It is a platformer in which the player must dodge several different enemies and projectiles and defeat a final boss. There are five levels. The first and second levels are just platforms and one enemy, which crawls along the bottom platform. The third level adds a flying enemy that shoots at the player's character and avoids being hit with attacks. Both enemies deal progressively more damage as the player gets past levels. The player gets a sword on level four, which allows the player to kill the enemies without taking any damage themselves. Both enemies disappear once the level reaches five, so that player can fight a final boss. The final boss shoots a lot of projectiles at the player and the projectiles deal a lot of damage. If the player blocks them, though, the boss takes damage and the player does not. The game ends if the player falls of the platforms, has a Health less than zero, or defeats the final boss. On the menu screen, if the user is idle too long, a slideshow will play that shows the backstory of the game. It has a test mode that can be turned on by pressing 1-3-3-7 on the keypad.</p>
