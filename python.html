		<h2>Unit 1</h2>
		<p>Description: In the first unit of Python, we only did basic stuff. We learned the basics of starting the program, ending the program, and some loops and syntax. Overall it was mostly getting used to using the new syntax, and the various mathematics commands.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to import pygame files, and use operations, loops, and variables. I learned how the syntax works in terms of the basic commands. I also learned how to organize the order of commands in Python so that my code drew my objects correctly.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>Unit 2</h2>
		<p>Description: In the second unit of Python, we had to use additional classes and objetcs, other than our core file, in order to use collide methods and other things. The overall ideas were similar to those of unit one, except we had to use the getRect commands. This warranted the use of those additional methods, so that the variables could be communicated through the main method yet still be unique to each object.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to create and import additional class files. I learned how call a specific method in the class to get the values out of it. I also learned how to format everything so that my other class files worked correctly.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>Unit 3</h2>
		<p>Description: In the third unit of Python, we were given problems that required complex loops to solve. These were mostly “While” statements, which checked variables, or a true/false condition. It would then run the commands based on the results.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to use the "while True" loop. I also learned how to coordinate all tabbing required for the loops to be properly read by the computer. I learned how to nest the while statements, and also I learned that "==" is often required in loops, which I didn't know before..</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>Unit 4</h2>
		<p>Description: In the fourth unit of Python, we had to write a program that required lists and call variables to complete. The lists were constructed using the ListName = ("Object1", "Object2", "Object3", etc.) setup. The lists made it much easier to switch between multiple costumes.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to use lists within class files for costumes and postions. I also learned how to use lists in the core program so that I could randomly generate objects. Lists made it easier to accomplish tasks where having multiple objects outside of a list would be too ineffecient.</p>
		</br>
		</br>
		<h2>Final Python Project</h2>
		<p>Description: We were instructed to create a game in Python. We had to have variables, classes, methods, and lists. I made a game based on the old Mega Man video game series, with Air Man as the final enemy. Mega Man could jump, run, and shoot at the enemies.<p>
