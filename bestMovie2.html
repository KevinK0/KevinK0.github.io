		<h3>Why I like this movie</h3>
		<p>This was a great movie. I really enjoyed it because it tied together the entire Star Wars story in a way that made a lot of sense.
I think that it had a great plot, and great acting. Also, it's sci-fi; I love sci-fi. </p>
		<h3>Favorite Actor</h3>
		<p> My favorite actor in Episode 3 is Ewan McGregor, who played Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's a great actor in general, but he did such a good job in this movie that I think I liked him more than my favorite character from the series, Mace Windu.
