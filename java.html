		<h2>Unit 1</h2>
		<p>Description: In the first, and only unit of Java, we learned how to print text, do basic math operations, and create and use varaibles. We solved simple problems that didnâ€™t require very many loops or if statements, just numbers and strings. Overall, it was a very basic introduction to Java.</p>
		<p>Concepts Learned: I learned how to print things, have the program add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. I learned how Java's syntax works. I also learned how to create and nest loops while I was at it.</p>
		</br>

		<h2>Adventure Project</h2>
		<p>Description: For the Adventure project, we had to make a choose-your-own-adventure style of game that would give the player options and allow them to guide the story by picking one or the other. The player would type in the word that corresponded with the choice they wanted to make, and the game would continue based on what they typed. It was required to have at least four choices down any given path, however mine had one premature ending (The result of the player just making really bad decisions) and some options that allowed the player top make up to five decions before they got to the end.</p>
